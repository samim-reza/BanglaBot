"""Clinic engine: doctor appointments (serials) for a chamber / clinic / diagnostic centre.

Inbound — the patient calls the clinic:

    intent ─ book ──────▶ doctor → patient_name → date → [phone] → read-back → book
           ├ reschedule ─▶ which appointment → date → read-back → move it
           └ cancel ─────▶ which appointment → read-back → cancel it
    (questions about doctors, fees, timings are answered from the catalog)

Outbound — the clinic calls a patient about an appointment (reminder):

    identity → attend? ─ yes → confirmed
                       └ no → new time? ─ yes → date → read-back → moved
                                        └ no → cancelled

A doctor sits on some weekdays for a session (e.g. Mon/Wed 17:00–21:00) cut
into slots of "minutes per patient". In South Asian chambers the slot's
position is the patient's *serial* (queue) number — said on the call when the
account uses queue numbers. The backend picks the slot nearest to the caller's
preferred time and reads it back; the model never invents availability.

_RULES = """You are the receptionist of a doctor's practice / clinic. You book doctor appointments and move or cancel existing ones. The system computes the appointment time (and queue number, where used).
- Never diagnose, never suggest medicines, tests or doses, never say whether a symptom is serious. For medical questions say the doctor will advise at the visit; if the facts list a health advice line, you may suggest it.
- Emergency (chest pain, breathing difficulty, stroke signs, heavy bleeding, unconsciousness, seizure, severe injury, pregnancy bleeding or severe pain, poisoning): call report_emergency immediately, nothing else.
- Never reveal another patient's details.
- Doctors: when saving `doctor`, use the ref from the doctor list (D1, D2, …). If the caller describes a problem instead of naming a doctor, you may name the matching department from the list (never diagnose); if several doctors fit, let the system ask.
- Intent: book = new appointment, reschedule = move an existing one, cancel = cancel an existing one. Questions about doctors, days, timings, fees or the address are answered from the facts below, then ask whether they would like an appointment.
- Dates: save `date` as YYYY-MM-DD from the calendar below ("tomorrow" = the next day, "the day after" = two days ahead; a weekday means the next such day). A preferred time goes in `time_pref` as HH:MM (24 h) or morning/afternoon/evening.
- Existing appointments of this caller are listed with refs (A1, A2, …); save the chosen one as `appointment`.
- Availability: you never know which times are free — the system does. When the caller wants another day or time, save it (date / time_pref) and the system proposes the nearest free time; never say a time is or isn't available yourself.
- The system reads the summary back and writes the booking. Never say an appointment is booked, moved or cancelled before a tool result says so."""
